The goal of the homework was to create a weekday calendar that would allow to input events on each hour-block and could be saved. Upon refresh, the events will remain there as saved. The hour-block would be color coded in different colors to represent past, present, and future. 

Challenge: Color coding the time block to represent the past, present and future was difficult.
